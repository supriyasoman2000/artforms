    <p class="card-text">Ottan Thullal (or Ottamthullal, Malayalam: ഓട്ടൻ തുള്ളൽ) is a recite-and-dance art-form of Kerala,india.It was introduced in the eighteenth century by Kunchan Nambiar, one of the Prachina Kavithrayam (three famous Malayalam-language poets). The folksy performance, often laced with humour intended at criticism of society, is accompanied by a mridangam (a barrel-shaped double-headed drum) and/or the handy idakka besides a pair of ilathalam cymbals.Like most Indian performing art forms, Ottamthullal has its principles influenced by the Natya Shastra (c. 2nd century BCE). The word Thullal means "to jump" or "leap about" in the Malayalam language.Legend has it that Nambiar, the poet, fell asleep while playing the mizhavu drum for a Chakyar Koothu performance, inviting ridicule from the chakyar. In response, Nambiar developed Ottamthullal, which raised prevalent sociopolitical questions and made a satire of human pedigrees and prejudices.</p>
